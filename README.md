## About The Project

A web application that provides a visual interface to manage a personal Hammerspace.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- npm

  Install npm as the service is based on React and uses npm as a package manager. _NOTE:_ This installation command requires [brew](https://brew.sh/) and only runs on Mac.

  ```sh
  $ brew install node
  ```

- Hammerspace backend

  Please refer to the [Hammerspace backend](https://github.com/hammerspace/backend) and ensure that it is properly setup and running before you continue to run the hammerspace frontend.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/Metaverse-Backpack/backpack-frontend.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   $ npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Development

For development, the frontend can be started with the following command:

```bash
# Start frontend in watch mode (automatically reload if files change)
$ npm run start
```

### Production

For production, the frontend can be build with the following command:

```bash
# Build service in production mode
$ npm run build
```

It builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
